hi, welcome to my blog. Today is all about elephants. 4

Did you know that elephants have six toes and five fingers? 
They also have horns growing out of their mouth like sharp angry teeth. 
They have a long nose like a vaccuum cleaner, with which they drink. It also helps them in their everyday life like an extra limb. They grab stuff with it, feel and touch their surroundings and other elephants with it and they bring their food to their mouth with it, like we would with our hands.
